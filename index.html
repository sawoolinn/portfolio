									DISP scholars at AUPP</h3>

									<p>After a devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, our DISP scholars group at AUPP came together to raise 
									</br>awareness and funds for those affected. As Myanmar scholars studying abroad, we could not assist on the ground, 
										but we dedicated </br> a week to sharing verified information, reaching out to international friends and their families, 
										and supporting donation efforts.</br> We also organized a juice sale as a fundraising activity during the Khmer Songkran 
										celebration on campus.</p>

									<p>The DISP Scholarship Program for Myanmar students was officially terminated on January 29, 2025. 
										This decision follows the suspension of U.S. foreign aid programs related to diversity, equity, inclusion, 
										and accessibility, as ordered by former President Donald Trump. The sudden cancellation has created uncertainty 
										and concern for the future of these students, many of whom rely on this opportunity to access higher education abroad.</p>

										They are all enthusiastic about making a positive impact in their communities and have demonstrated a strong commitment

									<p>When I saw the email “CONGRATULATIONS! You have been selected as a Cohort 1 Scholar of the USAID Diversity and

										competitive process. We had more than 2,000 well-qualified applicants for the 112 spaces available. I overcame many difficulties to get to this point. 
										When I heard the result, I was completely relieved and finally able to breathe. </p>
