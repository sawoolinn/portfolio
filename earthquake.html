				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/earthquake/e2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>After a devastating 7.7
					magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, hours later, we DISP scholars gathered and asked, "What are we going to
					do?" Some of our friends were crying because their families live in Mandalay.At that time, our DISP scholars group
					at AUPP decided to do the best we could to organize a donation event for those affected. As Myanmar
					scholars studying abroad, we could not assist on the ground, but we will do our best to support
					donation efforts. Our team also includes a musician artist named John Derek, who has a large
					following on his social media platforms and can reach out to many people. In addition, he is a
					well-reputed singer who has been an artist who opposes the military regime and stands on the side of
					justice, and has also held many donation events. Therefore, we decided to make the donation with
					great enthusiasm and care. In addition to the donation event, since the Khmer Songkran celebration
					on campus was approaching, we decided to hold a donation drive and sell Myanmar traditional juice to
					raise funds. Since then, our group DISP scholarship from AUPP which are 13 students, received
					donations from Thailand and Cambodia for the earthquake relief from March 29 to April 3. </p>

				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/earthquake/e3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I, Saw Kler
					Doh Shee, Maung Min Thant Htun, Khu Eugene, Saw Aung Myint Nyein, Sarah Mai are responsible for
					collecting donations in person and online. John Derek is responsible for communicating donation
					updates through his social media. Aye Myat Mon, Su Myat Kaythari, Nin Yandanar Htet Htet Tun, Lin
					Thu Thu Tun, Ma Htet Nyein Khant, and Ma Suyee worked diligently to systematically keep records of
					the incoming and outgoing donations, where they were going to donate, and where they had donated. We
					took great care to ensure transparency around the funding of a fundraising event. Women played a
					very important role in this donation. When a large amount of donations came in unexpectedly, the
					girls took care of the accounting. As a result, people gained their trust and donated more. I gained
					a lot of experience at that donation event and was particularly amazed by the women's ability to do
					so. Without them, it would have been very difficult to keep our records and exchange money. This
					donation event was a good deed for us before we parted ways. At this time, We all knew that we would
					lose our scholarship and have no future, and that we would be separated in a month or two, but we
					forgot about that and put in all our efforts to organize the donation event. That event was a moment
					I will never forget because it was a small action that had a big impact.</p>

				We have received the majority of the supplies and have been able to send them to the relief teams on
				the ground in an orderly manner to minimize waste. We have carefully screened and sent them to
				various locations where they are needed, not just one. We are working to carefully screen and send
				the remaining funds for rehabilitation. Now, we are stopping online fundraising and are
				collaborating with American University of Phnom Penh and Clean Yangon to raise funds. <br>
